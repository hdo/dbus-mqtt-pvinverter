# dbus-mqtt-pvinverter
Integrate MQTT inverter data into Victron Energies Venus OS

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects MQTT inverter data to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.

## My Setup

I'mm running a MQTT server for home automation purposes. There is a script polling data from my SMA PV inverter and publishing it to the MQTT server. Therefore I can subscribe to the topic to get the inverter data.

## Inspiration

Base on the following works - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:

- https://github.com/vikt0rm/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter
- https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus#pv-inverters

## How it works

Subscribes to MQTT topic to update inverter data.
